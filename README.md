This is a **single-player focused** modpack that adds some quality-of-life mods without alerting classic ATFC recipes and progression. It's pretty much ATFC but for the current year.

Often (A)TFC modpacks override original TFC behavior. e.g. tree chopping mods, or dynamic mining mod. In this modpack ATFC stays ATFC, but nice to have things are there too.
